## Requirements

* iOS 12 or later.
* Have a [OpenWeb](https://www.openweb.com) account

## Getting started

### Add the SDK to your project

#### Using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)
1. Set dependency as follows:
    `pod 'OpenWebSDK', '9.9.9-test1'`
2. Execute `pod install` in Terminal
3. Open workspace file and run

#### Using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager)
The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler.
Once you have your Swift package set up, adding SpotIM as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.
```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/SpotIM/openweb-ios-sdk-pod.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "9.9.9-test1"))
]
```
